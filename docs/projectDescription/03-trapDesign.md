## Muskrat Trap Design

The SMARTrap is a sophisticated muskrat trap designed to ensure efficient and humane monitoring and control of muskrat
populations.
It incorporates various sensors and IoT functionalities to provide real-time status updates and enhance the overall trapping process.

### Sensor Integration
1. **Magnetic Sensor on the Door**: The trap is equipped with a magnetic sensor placed on the door.
This sensor detects whether the door is open or closed.
When the door is closed, the sensor triggers a signal indicating that the trap is set and ready to capture a muskrat.
2. **Weight Sensor on the Bottom**: To detect the presence of an animal inside the trap, a weight sensor is installed on
   the bottom.
   This sensor acts like a button that gets pressed when an animal's weight is detected.
   Once the weight sensor is triggered, it indicates that an animal is inside the trap.
3. **Movement Detection Sensor**: A wire-based sensor is used to detect if the trap has been moved from its original
   position.
   If the wire is broken, it signifies that the trap has been displaced, and a signal is sent to notify the change in position.

### Signal Transmission
- **Animal Captured Signal**: If both the door is closed and the weight sensor detects an animal inside the trap, 
a signal is sent to the server application.
This ensures that the muskrat manager is immediately informed about the capture, allowing for prompt action to release the animal humanely.
- **Trap Movement Signal**: If the movement detection sensor indicates that the trap has been moved (wire broken),
a signal is sent to alert the managers. This feature helps in preventing theft or unauthorized relocation of the trap.

### Housekeeping and Maintenance
- **Battery Status Monitoring**: To ensure the trap remains operational, the status of the battery is continuously
  monitored and transmitted.
  This data helps in timely maintenance, ensuring the trap does not run out of power and remains functional over extended periods.

### Summary
The SMARTrap's design integrates multiple sensors to provide comprehensive monitoring and control.
The magnetic sensor, weight sensor, and movement detection sensor work together to ensure real-time updates on the
trap's status.
Additionally, battery status monitoring ensures the trap's reliability and longevity, making it an effective tool for humane muskrat management.
