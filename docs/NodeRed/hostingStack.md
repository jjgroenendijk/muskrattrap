## Hosting Stack
Muskrattrap makes use of the following open source projects for the server environment:
 - Arch Linux
 - Docker
 - Node Red
 - MySQL (MariaDB)
 - Grafana
 - And many more applications

The entire hosting stack is contained within a docker-compose file, for easy administration.
This hosting stack can run on a Raspberry Pi and on big servers, as it is quite portable.
