# Muskrat trap: The Intelligent Muskrat Trap

Welcome to the SMARTrap project! This initiative aims to develop a smart, humane, and efficient solution for controlling muskrat populations using IoT technology.

## Project Overview

Muskrats pose a significant threat to the integrity of water management systems in the Netherlands.
Traditional trapping methods are labor-intensive and often result in the death of the animal.
SMARTrap seeks to address these issues by creating a smart trap that:
- **Detects** whether the trap is open or closed
- **Identifies** if a muskrat has been captured
- **Monitors** trap movements
- **Reports** the health status of the trap

## Technology Stack
This solution leverages the following technologies:
- **The Things Uno** Development board for sensor integration and control
- **LoRaWAN** for long-range, low-power wireless communication
- **Node-RED** for data processing and automation
- **MySQL** for data storage
- **Grafana** for data visualization

## Goals

- **Non-lethal Trapping:** Ensure muskrats are captured alive and unharmed.
- **Remote Monitoring:** Allow water managers to check traps' status remotely, reducing labor and increasing efficiency.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Provide insights through data collection and visualization to improve muskrat control strategies.
