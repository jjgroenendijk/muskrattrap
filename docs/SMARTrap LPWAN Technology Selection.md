# **Analysis and Recommendation of LPWAN Technology for the SMARTrap Muskrat Monitoring System**

## **I. Executive Summary**

Muskrat burrowing activities pose a substantial threat to the integrity of dikes and banks in the Netherlands, potentially leading to catastrophic flooding. The SMARTrap project aims to mitigate this risk by developing an innovative, low-cost, and easily deployable Internet of Things (IoT) solution to transform traditional muskrat traps into intelligent, remotely monitored systems. This report provides an expert analysis of available Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies suitable for this application, focusing on LoRaWAN (both public and private network models) and cellular LPWAN alternatives (NB-IoT and LTE-M).  
The evaluation was guided by critical properties essential for the SMARTrap use-case: extensive and reliable coverage along dike systems, ultra-low power consumption for multi-year battery life, adequate data rate and payload capacity for trap status and location, scalability for widespread deployment, robust security, ease of deployment and management, and a low Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).  
The analysis reveals that while cellular LPWAN technologies like NB-IoT and LTE-M offer robust national coverage through established mobile network operators (KPN, Vodafone, Odido), LoRaWAN presents a compelling combination of features particularly well-suited to the SMARTrap project's unique constraints. Specifically, LoRaWAN's extremely low power consumption, flexibility in deployment models (public and private), and potential for lower long-term operational costs, especially at scale, make it highly attractive. Public LoRaWAN networks from providers such as Netmore Group and KPN offer nationwide coverage options, with Netmore providing a "coverage on demand" service beneficial for specific dike locations. The Things Industries offers both community-driven and commercial LoRaWAN services.  
However, for the SMARTrap project, a **private LoRaWAN network** emerges as the most strategically advantageous solution. This approach offers unparalleled control over network coverage, ensuring reliable connectivity in potentially challenging dike environments where public network performance might be variable. It also eliminates recurring per-device connectivity fees, leading to a significantly lower TCO for large-scale deployments anticipated by water boards. While requiring a higher upfront capital expenditure for gateways and a network server, the project's technical nature and the long-term operational horizon make this investment justifiable. A private network also ensures data sovereignty and aligns with the critical infrastructure management responsibilities of Dutch water boards.  
Therefore, this report recommends the **adoption of a private LoRaWAN network** for the SMARTrap system. This recommendation is substantiated by LoRaWAN's superior alignment with the project's power, cost, and deployment flexibility requirements. A phased approach, potentially beginning with pilot deployments using a public LoRaWAN provider to validate coverage and performance before committing to full-scale private infrastructure, is advised as a risk mitigation strategy. This will ensure the SMARTrap solution effectively supports Dutch water boards in managing muskrat populations, safeguarding critical water defenses, reducing operational costs, and adhering to animal welfare standards for non-lethal control.

## **II. Introduction**

The Netherlands faces a persistent and significant challenge from muskrat populations whose burrowing activities undermine the structural integrity of dikes and embankments, thereby increasing the risk of flooding in a country where a substantial portion of land lies below sea level \[User Query\]. Traditional methods for controlling these pests are often labor-intensive and costly, primarily due to the necessity for frequent manual inspections of traps distributed across extensive water networks \[User Query\]. Furthermore, there is an increasing societal and regulatory impetus towards adopting non-lethal control methods that comply with animal welfare laws \[User Query\].  
In response to these challenges, the SMARTrap project has been initiated. Its core objective is to develop and deploy a low-cost, easily deployable Internet of Things (IoT) solution designed to convert conventional muskrat traps into "SMARTraps" \[User Query\]. These intelligent traps will be capable of monitoring their status (e.g., open/closed, presence of a muskrat), geographical location, and their own operational health (e.g., battery level). This remote monitoring capability is expected to drastically reduce the need for manual inspections, thereby lowering operational costs and facilitating the timely management of trapped animals, which is crucial for non-lethal control strategies \[User Query\].  
The project has already outlined several key technical components, including the use of the Arduino IDE for embedded software development, Doxygen for documentation, Gitlab for version control, and the implementation of a custom payload structure with an external schema for efficient data transmission \[User Query\]. While LoRaWAN has been identified as the preferred communication technology, a thorough evaluation is warranted to ensure the optimal choice \[User Query\].  
This report presents an expert-level analysis of LoRaWAN and other pertinent LPWAN technologies available in the Netherlands. It aims to evaluate these options against the specific requirements of the SMARTrap project and provide a substantiated recommendation for the most suitable wireless technology. The analysis will consider factors such as coverage, power consumption, cost, scalability, security, and ease of deployment, all within the context of monitoring muskrat traps along Dutch dikes and waterways. The ultimate goal is to equip the SMARTrap project team with the necessary information to make an informed decision that ensures the project's success and its contribution to safeguarding Dutch water infrastructure.

## **III. Landscape of LPWAN Technologies in the Netherlands**

The selection of an appropriate LPWAN technology is pivotal for the success of the SMARTrap project. The Netherlands boasts a mature IoT landscape with several viable options across LoRaWAN and cellular LPWAN technologies.  
**A. LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network)**  
LoRaWAN is a low-power, wide-area networking protocol designed for wireless, battery-operated devices in regional, national, or global networks.1 It operates in unlicensed radio spectrum (e.g., 868 MHz in Europe), which allows for flexibility in deployment but also necessitates managing potential interference. The architecture typically involves end-nodes (sensors/devices like the SMARTraps), gateways that relay messages between end-nodes and a network server, a network server (LNS) that manages the network and routes data, and an application server that processes the application-specific data.2 Key characteristics include long-range communication (kilometers), very low power consumption enabling multi-year battery life, and relatively low data rates, making it ideal for applications transmitting small, infrequent data packets.1 This profile aligns well with the SMARTrap requirement for infrequent status updates from potentially remote locations.  
**1\. Public LoRaWAN Network Operators in the Netherlands**  
Several entities offer public LoRaWAN network services in the Netherlands, providing connectivity without the need for users to deploy and manage their own gateway infrastructure.

* a. Netmore Group:  
  Netmore Group provides nationwide LoRaWAN connectivity in the Netherlands and other European countries, operating a carrier-grade network monitored 24/7 and designed to support millions of devices.5 A key feature relevant to the SMARTrap project is their "coverage on demand" service, which guarantees coverage extension to specific areas within 7 days, potentially crucial for remote dike locations.5 Netmore offers an all-inclusive, predictable pricing model with volume discounts and a free trial option.5 Their LoRaWAN portal facilitates device and network management, providing real-time dashboards, mapping, and visualization of both measured and simulated coverage.5 The company emphasizes solutions for utilities, which aligns with the operational domain of water boards.5  
* b. KPN:  
  KPN, a major Dutch telecommunications provider, offers a nationwide LoRa network in the Netherlands.8 They provide a LoRa Device Management API for device activation, deactivation, and configuration management.10 KPN's broader IoT portfolio includes cellular LPWAN options like NB-IoT and LTE-M, supported by global roaming partners.11 Pricing for KPN LoRa is typically contract-based.10 User-reported pricing suggests costs around â‚¬1.50 per sensor per month, which could become a significant operational expense at large scales.13  
* c. The Things Industries (TTI) / The Things Network (TTN):  
  Based in Amsterdam, The Things Industries (TTI) offers commercial, enterprise-grade LoRaWAN solutions, including "The Things Stack," a comprehensive LoRaWAN Network Server designed for scalability and security.14 The Things Network (TTN) is a global, community-driven LoRaWAN network. TTI provides a "Discovery" plan, free for up to 10 devices and 1 gateway, which is suitable for evaluation and small-scale projects.16 Commercial pricing for TTI's cloud-hosted services includes a Standard plan at approximately $230 USD per month for up to 1000 devices and a Plus plan at around $360 USD per month, with options for AWS Launcher deployment offering tiered pricing based on device numbers.16 TTN coverage is crowdsourced by its community, and its extent can be visualized using tools like TTN Mapper and CoverageMap.net.19 Amsterdam, for instance, has a significant TTN community presence.21 This option provides a low-barrier entry for testing, with pathways to commercial-grade services.

**2\. Private LoRaWAN Networks**  
A private LoRaWAN network involves an organization deploying and managing its own gateways and LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS).22 This approach offers complete control over network configuration, coverage tailoring, and potentially enhanced security due to its closed-loop nature.22 While it requires a higher upfront capital expenditure (CAPEX) for hardware (gateways can range from approximately $300 to over $800 for outdoor/industrial models 25) and LNS setup (options include open-source solutions like ChirpStack, or commercial offerings from TTI for self-hosting 16), it can lead to lower long-term operational expenditures (OPEX) as per-device connectivity fees to external operators are eliminated.29 This model necessitates in-house technical expertise for deployment and ongoing maintenance.24 Given the SMARTrap project's technical team and the potential for large-scale, geographically concentrated deployments along dike systems, a private network is a strong contender.  
**B. Cellular LPWAN Technologies**  
Cellular LPWAN technologies operate in licensed spectrum and leverage existing mobile network operator (MNO) infrastructure, adhering to 3GPP standards.1 They generally offer high reliability and Quality of Service (QoS) but entail recurring network subscription costs.  
**1\. NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT)**  
NB-IoT is specifically designed for massive IoT deployments, offering very low power consumption, excellent signal penetration into buildings and potentially underground, and support for a high density of static devices transmitting small amounts of data.1 It can support up to 50,000 connections per network cell.33 These characteristics are appealing for fixed traps in challenging environments.  
Providers in the Netherlands include:

* **Vodafone:** Operates a national NB-IoT network and offers various LPWA solutions.34 While initial rollouts experienced some delays, the service is commercially available.38  
* **KPN:** Includes NB-IoT within its comprehensive M2M and IoT connectivity services.9  
* **Odido (formerly T-Mobile):** Provides NB-IoT connectivity through its "IoT Easy connect" service, which is based on the 1NCE platform.39 1NCE offers flexible SIM cards supporting multiple technologies including 2G, 3G, 4G, NB-IoT, and LTE-M, often with a flat-rate pricing model for long device lifecycles.39

**2\. LTE-M (Long Term Evolution for Machines)**  
LTE-M (also known as LTE Cat-M1) offers higher data rates (up to 1 Mbps) and lower latency compared to NB-IoT and LoRaWAN.1 It supports device mobility with handover between cells and has the potential for Voice over LTE (VoLTE) in the future, making it suitable for a broader range of applications, including those requiring more bandwidth or voice capabilities.31 While its power consumption is optimized, it is generally higher than that of LoRaWAN or NB-IoT.1  
Providers in the Netherlands include:

* **Vodafone:** Has live LTE-M services in the Netherlands.34  
* **KPN:** Offers LTE-M as part of its IoT connectivity solutions.9  
* **Odido (formerly T-Mobile):** Provides LTE-M through the "IoT Easy connect" service powered by 1NCE.39 Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile's former parent company, also actively promotes LTE-M.31

The Dutch market presents a robust selection of LPWAN options. Major telecommunications operators like KPN, Vodafone, and Odido are key players in the cellular LPWAN space and, in some cases (like KPN), also offer LoRaWAN services. This overlap could be advantageous if the water boards envision a broader IoT strategy encompassing diverse applications beyond muskrat trapping, potentially allowing for a consolidated relationship with a single connectivity provider. However, the specific requirements of the SMARTrap projectâ€”particularly its deployment along extensive, linear dike systems where tailored coverage might be paramountâ€”highlight the viability of private LoRaWAN networks as a strong alternative to public offerings. The availability of multiple mature technologies necessitates a careful evaluation based on the project's unique critical properties.

## **IV. Critical Technology Properties for the SMARTrap Use-Case**

To determine the most suitable LPWAN technology for the SMARTrap project, a set of critical properties must be defined. These properties derive directly from the project's objectives and operational context.  
A. Coverage  
Reliable signal coverage is paramount. Traps will be deployed along extensive dike systems, often situated in rural, sparsely populated, or waterside areas.5 Effective communication requires signals to reach devices that may be at ground level or even partially within muskrat burrows, necessitating good penetration characteristics. While many providers claim "nationwide" coverage 5, the actual performance in these specific micro-environments must be carefully considered. LoRaWAN is known for its long-range capabilities, including indoor and outdoor reach.2 Cellular LPWAN technologies like NB-IoT are designed for deep indoor and even underground penetration.32 Connectivity failure due to inadequate coverage would render the SMARTrap system ineffective, as missed trap activations or animal presence alerts would negate the benefits of remote monitoring.  
B. Power Consumption & Battery Life  
Minimizing power consumption is essential to achieve long battery life, thereby reducing the frequency of manual interventions for battery replacement and lowering operational costs \[User Query\]. This is particularly critical given the anticipated large number of "easily deployable" traps. LoRaWAN and NB-IoT are engineered for ultra-low power operation, with manufacturers often citing potential battery life of 10 to 15 years or more under optimal conditions.1 LTE-M, while also optimized for low power, generally consumes more energy than LoRaWAN or NB-IoT, especially in scenarios with frequent data transmission or when mobility features are active.1 The actual battery longevity will depend on factors such as payload size, message transmission frequency, network signal strength, and the power-saving modes employed by the device and network. For the SMARTrap project, the goal is to maximize battery life to make the solution economically and logistically viable.  
C. Data Rate & Payload Capacity  
The chosen technology must support the transmission of essential data from each SMARTrap, including its status (open/closed, muskrat present), GPS location, and device health indicators like battery level \[User Query\]. LoRaWAN is characterized by low data rates and small payload capacities (typically ranging from 11 to 242 bytes, with practical payloads around 50 bytes being common 1). NB-IoT and LTE-M offer higher data rates and larger payload capacities (e.g., up to 1280 bytes for NB-IoT/LTE-M modules 1). The SMARTrap project specifies a "custom payload with an external schema," indicating an intention to optimize data packets for efficiency \[User Query\]. The technology must provide sufficient capacity for this optimized data without being excessive, as higher data rates often correlate with increased power consumption and cost.  
D. Scalability & Network Capacity  
The SMARTrap system must be scalable to support a potentially large number of devices deployed across the operational regions of various Dutch water boards. LoRaWAN network scalability can depend on factors like gateway density, channel utilization, and adherence to duty cycle regulations in unlicensed bands; however, it has been successfully deployed in large-scale applications.44 Cellular LPWAN technologies like NB-IoT and LTE-M are designed to support a very high density of devices per cell, leveraging the robust capacity of existing cellular networks.33 The chosen solution must accommodate future growth in the number of deployed traps without significant degradation in performance or a prohibitive increase in costs.  
E. Security  
Robust security mechanisms are crucial for protecting the integrity of the data transmitted by the SMARTraps and for preventing unauthorized access to or control of the devices. This includes end-to-end encryption of data payloads and secure device authentication. LoRaWAN incorporates security features such as AES-128 encryption for both network and application data.5 NB-IoT and LTE-M rely on the comprehensive security standards developed by 3GPP for cellular networks, which include strong encryption algorithms (e.g., 256-bit encryption mentioned for NB-IoT, 128-bit AES for LTE-M) and SIM-based authentication.32 Ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of trap data and control mechanisms is essential for operational reliability and preventing misuse.  
F. Deployment & Management  
The requirement for "easily deployable" nodes is a key design consideration for the SMARTrap project \[User Query\]. This encompasses the ease of physical installation, device provisioning, network onboarding, and ongoing remote management. The project's existing technical framework, including the Arduino IDE, Doxygen for documentation, Gitlab for version control, and custom payload handling, must be compatible with the chosen technology's ecosystem \[User Query\]. The availability and quality of provider portals, APIs for automation (e.g., Netmore LoRaWAN portal 5, KPN LoRa Device Management API 10), and tools for device monitoring and troubleshooting will significantly impact operational efficiency. Complex deployment or management processes would create barriers to adoption and increase long-term operational overhead.  
G. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)  
The "low-cost" imperative is a primary driver for the SMARTrap project \[User Query\]. TCO provides a comprehensive financial assessment, encompassing all direct and indirect costs over the system's lifecycle. Key components include:

* **Hardware Costs:** Costs of the sensor nodes (including LoRaWAN/NB-IoT/LTE-M modules, which typically range from $8-$12 48) and, if a private network is chosen, the cost of gateways.  
* **Connectivity Fees:** For public networks, these are typically recurring charges per device or per unit of data consumed.29 Examples include KPN's reported â‚¬1.50/sensor/month 13 or Vodafone's NB-IoT SIM data packages.50  
* **Network Server Costs:** Applicable to private LoRaWAN deployments or for accessing advanced features on some public network platforms. Various pricing models exist, from free open-source options to tiered commercial subscriptions.16  
* **Deployment and Installation Costs:** Labor and materials associated with setting up the traps and any necessary network infrastructure.  
* **Maintenance Costs:** Ongoing expenses, including battery replacement, device repair or replacement, and network upkeep. The economic viability of deploying SMARTraps at scale hinges on achieving a low TCO. The choice between public and private network models, particularly for LoRaWAN, significantly influences the TCO structure, with private networks often presenting a trade-off between higher CAPEX and lower OPEX.22

These critical properties are interconnected. For instance, poor network coverage can force devices to transmit at higher power levels or retransmit messages, thereby drastically reducing battery life and impacting the TCO. Similarly, the choice of data rate affects time-on-air, which in turn influences power consumption. For very small, infrequent messages typical of the SMARTrap application, the ultra-low sleep currents achievable with LoRaWAN or NB-IoT might offer greater power savings than the shorter transmission times of a higher-bandwidth technology like LTE-M, whose baseline modem power might be higher. Furthermore, the non-lethal trapping aspect implies a need for timely notification to ensure animal welfare. While LPWANs are not designed for real-time, high-speed communication, consistent and predictable message delivery is important. This consideration might influence decisions regarding acknowledged versus unacknowledged messaging protocols (e.g., in LoRaWAN) or favor technologies with inherently lower latency if deemed critical and worth any associated power or cost trade-offs. A holistic assessment that considers these interdependencies is essential for selecting the optimal technology.

## **V. Comparative Analysis of LPWAN Options**

This section provides a comparative analysis of the identified LPWAN technologies, first at a high technical level and then focusing on specific provider options relevant to the Netherlands, all evaluated against the critical properties established for the SMARTrap project.  
**A. LoRaWAN vs. NB-IoT vs. LTE-M: High-Level Technical Comparison**  
A foundational understanding of the inherent strengths and weaknesses of each technology class is crucial before considering specific provider implementations.

* **Coverage:**  
  * **LoRaWAN:** Offers excellent communication range, potentially up to 5-20 km depending on terrain and gateway placement.1 It supports flexible deployment through public networks, community-driven initiatives (like TTN), or private, user-owned infrastructure.48 This flexibility is a significant advantage for tailoring coverage to specific, challenging environments like dike systems.  
  * **NB-IoT & LTE-M:** Rely on existing cellular MNO infrastructure. While national coverage for standard cellular services is generally good in the Netherlands, the specific coverage and penetration of NB-IoT and LTE-M in remote or unique terrains like dikes must be verified.4 NB-IoT is particularly noted for its enhanced penetration capabilities.31  
* **Power Consumption & Battery Life:**  
  * **LoRaWAN:** Generally considered the leader for ultra-low power consumption, enabling battery life of 10-15+ years for devices sending infrequent, small data packets.3  
  * **NB-IoT:** Also offers very low power consumption, suitable for 10+ years of battery life in many static applications.1 Its power efficiency is comparable to LoRaWAN for certain use profiles.  
  * **LTE-M:** Provides optimized low power modes but typically consumes more power than LoRaWAN or NB-IoT, especially if its higher data rate or mobility features are utilized.1 For purely static, low-data applications like SMARTraps, this might be a disadvantage.  
* **Data Rate & Payload Capacity:**  
  * **LoRaWAN:** Offers the lowest data rates (0.3-50 kbps) and smallest payload sizes (e.g., 11-242 bytes, often practically limited to around 51 bytes for optimal battery life in some regions after overhead).1 This is generally sufficient for the SMARTrap's needs of transmitting status, location, and health data, especially with a custom, optimized payload.  
  * **NB-IoT:** Provides higher data rates than LoRaWAN (up to \~250 kbps downlink, \~66 kbps uplink) and larger payload capacity (up to 1280 bytes).1  
  * **LTE-M:** Offers the highest data rates among the three (up to 1 Mbps) and similar payload capacity to NB-IoT.1 This capacity is likely an over-specification for the current SMARTrap requirements.  
* **Scalability & Network Capacity:**  
  * **LoRaWAN:** Public networks are designed for large numbers of devices. Private network scalability depends on the architecture, particularly gateway density and capacity of the LNS.44 A single gateway can typically handle thousands of end-nodes.  
  * **NB-IoT & LTE-M:** Leverage the high capacity of cellular networks, designed to support a massive density of IoT devices per cell (e.g., NB-IoT up to 50,000 per cell).33 Scalability is largely managed by the MNO.  
* **Security:**  
  * **LoRaWAN:** Implements end-to-end security using AES-128 encryption for network session keys and application session keys, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity from the device to the application server.5  
  * **NB-IoT & LTE-M:** Benefit from the robust, standardized security mechanisms inherent in 3GPP cellular networks, including strong encryption algorithms (e.g., 256-bit 3GPP encryption for NB-IoT, 128-bit AES for LTE-M) and SIM card-based authentication and security.32  
* **Deployment Complexity:**  
  * **LoRaWAN:** Public network deployment is straightforward for end-devices if coverage exists. Private network deployment requires planning and installation of gateways and an LNS, demanding more technical effort.22  
  * **NB-IoT & LTE-M:** Device connection is generally simpler if MNO coverage is adequate, as the network infrastructure is already in place and managed by the operator.48  
* **Cost (Indicative):**  
  * **LoRaWAN:** Module costs are typically the lowest among the three (around $8-10).48 For private networks, there are no recurring connectivity fees per device, but CAPEX for infrastructure is required. Public LoRaWAN involves subscription fees.29  
  * **NB-IoT & LTE-M:** Module costs are slightly higher than LoRaWAN (around $10-12 for NB-IoT).48 Both involve recurring SIM card and data/connectivity subscription fees from MNOs.29

For the SMARTrap's core requirementsâ€”minimal data, extremely long battery life, static deployment, and low operational costâ€”LoRaWAN and NB-IoT appear to be more closely aligned than LTE-M. The higher data rates and mobility support of LTE-M are less critical for this specific application and may come at an unnecessary power consumption premium.  
**Table 2: High-Level Comparison of LPWAN Technologies for SMARTraps**

| Feature | LoRaWAN | NB-IoT | LTE-M |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Coverage Range** | Very Long (5-20km) 1 | Long (1-10km, good penetration) 1 | Long (1-10km, good penetration) 1 |
| **Coverage Type** | Public, Private, Community | Cellular MNO | Cellular MNO |
| **Power Consumption (Battery Life)** | Ultra-Low (10-15+ years) 43 | Very Low (10+ years) 1 | Low (Years, higher than LoRaWAN/NB-IoT) 1 |
| **Data Rate Suitability (SMARTrap)** | Sufficient (0.3-50 kbps) 48 | Sufficient to High (\<250 kbps) 48 | High (1 Mbps) 1 |
| **Payload Capacity Suitability (SMARTrap)** | Sufficient (11-242 bytes) 1 | More than sufficient (1280 bytes) 1 | More than sufficient (1280 bytes) 1 |
| **Scalability (Device Density)** | Good (Private depends on gateways; Public is high) 44 | Very High (Carrier managed) 33 | Very High (Carrier managed) 47 |
| **Security Robustness** | Strong (AES-128 E2E) 5 | Very Strong (3GPP standards, SIM-based) 32 | Very Strong (3GPP standards, SIM-based) 47 |
| **Indicative Module Cost** | Low ($8-10) 48 | Moderate ($10-12) 48 | Moderate to High |
| **Indicative Connectivity Cost** | Variable (None for private; Subscriptions for public) 13 | Subscription-based (SIM \+ data) 29 | Subscription-based (SIM \+ data) 29 |
| **Deployment Complexity (Device)** | Simple (Public); Higher (Private \- gateways) 48 | Simple (if coverage exists) 48 | Simple (if coverage exists) 48 |

**B. Detailed Provider/Network Comparison for the Netherlands**  
Given the initial assessment that LoRaWAN appears highly suitable, a detailed comparison of LoRaWAN options is warranted. Cellular LPWANs remain alternatives, particularly if insurmountable LoRaWAN coverage issues arise.  
**1\. LoRaWAN Options Detailed Comparison**  
The primary LoRaWAN options for the SMARTrap project in the Netherlands are public networks (Netmore, KPN LoRa, TTI Commercial) and a self-deployed private LoRaWAN network.

* **Coverage:**  
  * **Netmore Group:** Claims nationwide LoRaWAN coverage and uniquely offers "coverage on demand" with a 7-day guarantee.5 Their portal allows visualization of measured and simulated coverage.5 This is a significant advantage for ensuring connectivity along specific, potentially remote dike stretches.  
  * **KPN LoRa:** Also claims nationwide LoRa network coverage.8 Verification for specific dike locations would rely on their general cellular coverage maps (which may not detail LoRa-specific signal strength at ground level) or direct inquiry.53  
  * **TTI Commercial / TTN:** Coverage through TTI's commercial offerings would depend on deploying gateways or using existing TTN community gateways. TTN coverage is user-dependent and can be checked via TTN Mapper 19, but reliability for critical infrastructure monitoring based solely on community gateways is questionable without SLAs.  
  * **Private LoRaWAN:** Coverage is entirely determined by the project's own gateway deployment strategy. This allows for highly optimized and guaranteed coverage for the specific dike areas of interest but requires careful planning for gateway placement, potentially using RF planning tools and site surveys.54 A critical challenge with all public options is verifying granular coverage in the unique topography of dikes and watersides. General "nationwide" claims may not translate to reliable connectivity for low-power devices at ground level or in burrows. This uncertainty elevates the value of Netmore's "coverage on demand" or the control offered by a private network. Pilot testing in representative dike environments will be essential irrespective of the chosen LoRaWAN approach.  
* **Pricing Models & TCO:**  
  * **Netmore Group:** Offers an all-inclusive, predictable pricing model with volume discounts.5 This simplifies budgeting.  
  * **KPN LoRa:** Typically contract-based, with some user reports suggesting around â‚¬1.50/sensor/month.10 For thousands of traps, this would amount to a substantial annual OPEX.  
  * **TTI Commercial:** Offers tiered plans (e.g., \~$230/month for 1000 devices) and pay-as-you-go for additional devices.16 The free "Discovery" tier is suitable only for very small pilots.  
  * **Private LoRaWAN:** Involves upfront CAPEX for gateways (e.g., RAKwireless outdoor gateways $322-$859 each 25) and a Network Server (LNS options range from free open-source like ChirpStack to commercial licenses for TTI Stack or LORIOT 17). Ongoing OPEX includes backhaul for gateways (e.g., cellular, Ethernet) and maintenance, but no per-device connectivity fees to an MNO. The TCO is heavily influenced by scale. For a small number of devices, public networks are often cheaper initially. However, as the device count grows into the thousands (as anticipated for widespread muskrat control), a private LoRaWAN network can become significantly more cost-effective over a 5-10 year lifespan due to the elimination of recurring per-device fees.24 If, for example, 5,000 traps were deployed on a public network at â‚¬1/device/month, the annual cost would be â‚¬60,000. The CAPEX for a private network to cover the same, potentially concentrated areas, might be recovered within a short period.  
* **Scalability & Device Management:**  
  * **Public Providers (Netmore, KPN, TTI):** Offer dedicated portals and APIs for device registration, management, and data access.5 These platforms are designed for scalability.  
  * **Private LoRaWAN:** Scalability depends on the chosen LNS and the gateway network architecture. Open-source LNS solutions like ChirpStack are highly scalable, as are commercial options like TTI Stack. Management is via the chosen LNS interface.  
* Ease of Integration for SMARTraps:  
  LoRaWAN, as a standard, is generally flexible. Most LoRaWAN modules and development platforms (including Arduino-compatible ones) allow for custom payload formats and straightforward integration with application servers. The key is the LNS's ability to decode the custom payload and forward it appropriately. All considered LoRaWAN options should support this.  
* **Support & SLA:**  
  * **Commercial Public Providers (Netmore, KPN, TTI):** Offer defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and technical support channels.16 This is crucial for operational reliability.  
  * **Private LoRaWAN:** Support and uptime are the responsibility of the deploying organization's technical team.  
  * **TTN (Community):** Offers no SLA or guaranteed support, making it unsuitable for a critical application like SMARTraps beyond initial experimentation.  
* Suitability for Dike Monitoring:  
  The linear nature of dikes, often in rural or challenging RF environments, presents unique coverage demands.  
  * **Netmore's "coverage on demand"** is a strong plus.  
  * **Private LoRaWAN** allows for strategic gateway placement to ensure coverage along these specific corridors, potentially including directional antennas or gateways at elevated positions.54  
  * **KPN and TTI (public)** would require careful coverage verification for each dike segment.

**2\. Cellular LPWAN Options (NB-IoT/LTE-M) Considerations**  
If LoRaWAN (either public or private) were found to have insurmountable coverage or reliability issues for the dike environments, NB-IoT would be the next most logical consideration due to its excellent penetration and low power characteristics, aligning better with SMARTrap needs than LTE-M.

* **Providers:** Vodafone, KPN, and Odido (via 1NCE) all offer NB-IoT in the Netherlands.9  
* **Coverage:** While leveraging national cellular footprints, specific NB-IoT coverage needs verification using provider tools (e.g., Onomondo's platform lists NB-IoT networks 56, general MNO coverage maps like nPerf 53 give an indication but are not LPWAN-specific). Vodafone stated NB-IoT networks in 18 countries as of 2021\.37  
* **Pricing:** Involves SIM card costs and data plans (e.g., Vodafone UK pricing from Â£0.32/month for 1MB 50; 1NCE offers flat-rate IoT SIMs 39).  
* **Power:** NB-IoT is designed for long battery life, comparable to LoRaWAN for static devices.1 The main drawback compared to private LoRaWAN would be the recurring connectivity costs and reliance on MNOs for coverage in potentially challenging locations. However, the simplicity of device connection if coverage is good is an advantage. LTE-M is generally less suitable due to higher power consumption for this static, low-data use case.

The analysis indicates that while public LoRaWAN networks offer viable paths, the control, tailored coverage, and long-term TCO benefits of a private LoRaWAN make it a very strong candidate for the SMARTrap project, especially considering the project's technical capabilities and the critical nature of dike monitoring.

## **VI. Substantiated Recommendation**

Based on the comprehensive analysis of available LPWAN technologies and their alignment with the critical requirements of the SMARTrap project, a specific technology and deployment strategy is recommended.  
**A. Most Suitable LPWAN Technology for SMARTraps:**  
The most suitable LPWAN technology for the SMARTrap project is **LoRaWAN**.  
**B. Recommended Network Provider(s) or Deployment Strategy:**  
The recommended deployment strategy is the establishment of a **Private LoRaWAN Network**, managed by the project consortium or the respective water boards.  
**C. Detailed Justification:**  
The recommendation for a private LoRaWAN network is based on its superior alignment with the SMARTrap project's core objectives of low cost, ease of deployment (at the node level), long battery life, and the specific operational context of monitoring critical infrastructure like dikes.

1. Coverage for Dike Environments:  
   A private LoRaWAN network offers the highest degree of control over network coverage. Dikes represent linear, often geographically challenging environments where standard public network coverage might be inconsistent or require costly "on-demand" extensions. By strategically deploying their own gatewaysâ€”potentially leveraging existing water board infrastructure for mountingâ€”the project can ensure reliable signal reach to all traps, even in remote or RF-obstructed locations.22 This tailored coverage is critical, as connectivity gaps would undermine the entire system's purpose. While public providers like Netmore offer "coverage on demand" 5, relying on this for extensive dike networks could become complex and costly over time compared to a one-time, optimized private deployment.  
2. Power Consumption and Battery Life:  
   LoRaWAN is renowned for its ultra-low power consumption, making it ideal for battery-operated devices intended to last for many years (10-15+ years cited 5). This aligns perfectly with the SMARTrap's need to minimize manual interventions for battery replacement, which would otherwise negate the cost savings from remote monitoring. A private network allows for optimization of network parameters (e.g., data rates, acknowledgment schemes) that can further enhance battery life, a level of control not typically available with public networks.  
3. Data Requirements and Custom Payload:  
   LoRaWAN's capacity for small data packets is well-suited for the SMARTrap's needs: trap status, location, and device health.1 The project's plan for a custom payload with an external schema \[User Query\] indicates efficient data handling, making LoRaWAN's payload size adequate. There is no need for the higher bandwidth offered by LTE-M or even the upper ranges of NB-IoT, which would come at a power and cost premium.  
4. Scalability and Network Capacity:  
   A private LoRaWAN network can be scaled by adding more gateways as the number of traps or coverage area increases.44 Modern LoRaWAN Network Servers (LNS), whether open-source like ChirpStack or commercial like The Things Stack (self-hosted), are capable of managing thousands to millions of devices.15 This ensures the solution can grow from pilot phases to widespread deployment across multiple water board regions.  
5. Security:  
   Private LoRaWAN networks offer a high degree of security control.22 The organization manages its own network keys and application keys, and the network is inherently a closed-loop system, reducing exposure to external threats compared to shared public infrastructure. This robust security is essential for critical infrastructure monitoring.  
6. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):  
   This is a decisive factor. While a private LoRaWAN network requires upfront CAPEX for gateways (e.g., $300-$900 per outdoor gateway 25\) and an LNS, it eliminates recurring per-device connectivity fees charged by public network operators.24 For a large-scale deployment (e.g., thousands of SMARTraps), the annual savings from avoiding these fees can quickly offset the initial investment, leading to a significantly lower TCO over the system's lifespan (5-10+ years).29 Public LoRaWAN or cellular LPWAN subscriptions, even at â‚¬1-â‚¬2 per device per month, would accumulate to substantial ongoing operational costs.13 The "low-cost" objective of the SMARTrap project is best served by this long-term TCO advantage.  
7. Deployment, Management, and Project Alignment:  
   The SMARTrap project team has specified the use of Arduino, Doxygen, and Gitlab, indicating in-house technical capabilities \[User Query\]. Managing a private LoRaWAN network, while requiring technical expertise, aligns with this skill set. It offers maximum flexibility in device choice and firmware development, avoiding potential MNO certifications or module restrictions associated with cellular IoT. The "easily deployable" nature of the nodes themselves is preserved, with the main deployment effort shifting to the strategic placement of gateways.  
8. Data Ownership and Strategic Control:  
   A private network ensures that the water boards retain full ownership and control over their data and the network infrastructure.22 For critical environmental and infrastructure data, this sovereignty is a significant strategic advantage, aligning with the public responsibilities of water boards.59 It avoids long-term dependency on third-party providers whose pricing or service strategies might change.

While NB-IoT offers good penetration and low power, the recurring costs and reliance on MNO coverage make it less optimal than private LoRaWAN for this specific large-scale, cost-sensitive application focused on defined geographical areas (dikes).  
**D. Key Implementation Considerations and Potential Risks:**

* **For Private LoRaWAN:**  
  * **Gateway Selection and Placement:** Careful selection of industrial-grade outdoor gateways and strategic placement is crucial for optimal coverage and resilience.54 RF planning and site surveys will be necessary.  
  * **Backhaul:** Reliable backhaul connectivity (e.g., cellular, Ethernet, potentially satellite in very remote spots) must be provisioned for each gateway.  
  * **LNS Selection and Management:** Choosing an appropriate LNS (open-source like ChirpStack or a self-hosted commercial solution) and ensuring its proper configuration, maintenance, and security is vital.  
  * **Technical Expertise:** The project team or water board staff will need the skills to deploy, manage, and troubleshoot the private network.  
  * **Interference:** Operating in unlicensed spectrum means LoRaWAN is susceptible to interference, although its robust modulation helps mitigate this. Careful channel planning and gateway placement can minimize impact.  
* **General Risks:**  
  * **Underestimation of Deployment Complexity:** Deploying any IoT solution in challenging outdoor environments like dikes can present unforeseen logistical challenges.  
  * **Environmental Factors:** Traps and gateways must be ruggedized to withstand weather, potential vandalism, and animal interaction.  
  * **Scalability Challenges:** While the technology is scalable, managing a very large fleet of devices (thousands) requires robust backend systems and processes.  
* Risk Mitigation \- Phased Approach and Pilot Testing:  
  A crucial risk mitigation strategy is to conduct thorough pilot testing before a full-scale rollout. This could involve:  
  1. Initial small-scale tests using a public LoRaWAN provider (e.g., Netmore, given their "coverage on demand" feature 5) to validate basic device functionality, data transmission, and gather preliminary coverage data in representative dike locations.  
  2. If initial tests are promising, deploy a small private LoRaWAN pilot (e.g., 2-3 gateways and a few dozen traps) to gain hands-on experience with gateway installation, LNS management, and real-world performance. This phased approach allows for iterative learning, refinement of the solution, and a more accurate assessment of TCO before committing to large-scale private network infrastructure.

By adopting a private LoRaWAN strategy, informed by careful pilot testing, the SMARTrap project can develop a highly effective, cost-efficient, and sustainable solution for muskrat management in the Netherlands.

## **VII. Conclusion**

The SMARTrap project addresses a critical need for enhanced monitoring of muskrat traps to protect Dutch dikes and waterways. The selection of an appropriate LPWAN technology is fundamental to achieving the project's goals of a low-cost, easily deployable, and effective IoT solution that supports non-lethal control methods.  
Following a comprehensive analysis of available LoRaWAN (public and private) and cellular LPWAN (NB-IoT, LTE-M) options in the Netherlands, this report concludes that **LoRaWAN** is the most suitable core technology. Specifically, a **private LoRaWAN network deployment strategy** is recommended.  
This recommendation is underpinned by several key advantages directly relevant to the SMARTrap use-case:

* **Tailored Coverage:** Private LoRaWAN allows for optimized network coverage along dike systems, ensuring reliable connectivity where public networks might be inconsistent.  
* **Ultra-Low Power Consumption:** LoRaWAN's inherent energy efficiency is critical for achieving multi-year battery life for a large number of deployed traps, minimizing maintenance and operational costs.  
* **Cost-Effectiveness at Scale:** While requiring upfront investment, a private network eliminates recurring per-device connectivity fees, leading to a significantly lower Total Cost of Ownership for large-scale deployments compared to public LoRaWAN or cellular LPWAN alternatives.  
* **Control and Flexibility:** A private network provides full control over network configuration, security, data management, and integration with the project's existing technical stack (Arduino, custom payloads), fostering innovation and avoiding vendor lock-in.  
* **Data Sovereignty:** Full ownership of the network and data is strategically important for water boards managing critical public infrastructure.

The implementation of a private LoRaWAN network, ideally preceded by focused pilot testing to refine deployment strategies and validate performance, will empower Dutch water boards with a powerful tool. This will enable more efficient and cost-effective muskrat population management, contribute to the safety and integrity of vital water defenses, reduce labor-intensive manual inspections, and support adherence to animal welfare principles. By carefully addressing the outlined implementation considerations, the SMARTrap project is well-positioned to deliver a sustainable and impactful solution to a long-standing environmental and infrastructural challenge in the Netherlands.
