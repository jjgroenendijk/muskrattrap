# IoT-muskrattrap: The Intelligent Muskrat Trap

## Project Overview

The SMARTrap project aims to develop a smart, humane, and efficient solution for controlling muskrat populations using IoT technology. Muskrats pose a significant threat to water management systems in the Netherlands. This project seeks to create a smart trap that detects trap status (open/closed), identifies captures, monitors trap movement, and reports its health status, all while ensuring non-lethal trapping and enabling remote monitoring.

Detailed project documentation, including design choices, technical specifications, and setup guides, can now be found in the `/docs` directory. This includes:

* `docs/project-background.md`: Covers initial research, LPWAN/LoRaWAN comparisons, and trap design considerations.
* `docs/iot-node-details.md`: Details the IoT node hardware simulation and LoRaWAN payload structure.
* `docs/server-and-nodered-setup.md`: Outlines the server-side stack, database, and Node-RED setup.
* `docs/mini-research-summary.md`: The Mini-Research summary in English Markdown.
* `docs/doxygen/`: Doxygen-generated API documentation for the codebase (also published to GitHub Pages).

The `docs-old/` directory has been removed as its content has been migrated and consolidated into the `docs/` directory.

## Environment Setup

* **Operating System:** macOS
* **Default Shell:** bash
* **Python Environment:** (To be determined if Python will be used for new development. If so, `uv` will be used for package management.)

## Technology Stack

* **IoT Node Hardware:** The Things Uno (Arduino Leonardo based)
* **Communication:** LoRaWAN (via The Things Network - TTN)
* **Data Processing & Automation:** Node-RED
* **Data Storage:** MySQL (MariaDB)
* **Data Visualization:** Grafana
* **Server Orchestration:** Docker & Docker Compose

## Replication Guide & Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Git
* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Arduino IDE (for node development)

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:jjgroenendijk/muskrattrap.git
    cd muskrattrap
    ```

### Development Workflow with VSCode Tasks

This project includes VSCode tasks for common development actions, defined in `.vscode/tasks.json`. You can run these tasks from the Command Palette (View > Command Palette or Ctrl+Shift+P/Cmd+Shift+P) by typing "Tasks: Run Task" and selecting the desired task.

Available tasks:

* **Compile LoRaWAN Node (nodeCode.ino):** Compiles the main Arduino sketch for the LoRaWAN node using `arduino-cli`.
* **Build PayloadCoder Executable:** Builds the C++ `payloadCoder` test executable using `make` in the `payloadCoder/` directory.
* **Run PayloadCoder Unit Tests:** Runs the unit tests for the C++ `payloadCoder` by executing the compiled test program. This task depends on the successful build of the executable.
* **Monitor Arduino (nodeCode.ino) - Auto-detect Port:** Opens a serial monitor for the LoRaWAN node using `arduino-cli monitor`. This task attempts to automatically find the serial port for an Arduino Leonardo-compatible board (works best on macOS/Linux if only one such board is connected). If it fails, or if you have multiple boards, you might need to use the manual command line method described in the "Node (The Things Uno) Development" section.
* **Generate Doxygen Documentation:** Generates Doxygen documentation for the entire project using the `Doxyfile` in the project root. The output will be in `docs/doxygen`.
* **Start/Update Server Applications (Docker Compose):** Starts or updates all server-side applications (Node-RED, MariaDB, phpMyAdmin, Grafana) defined in `serverSide/docker-compose.yml`. It uses the `--force-recreate` flag to ensure containers are updated with any image changes. This task is run from the `serverSide/` directory.

These tasks help streamline the compilation and testing processes directly within VSCode.

### Server-Side Development

1. Navigate to the server-side directory:

    ```bash
    cd serverSide
    ```

2. Ensure the `docker-compose.yml` file has a secure password for MariaDB (currently `# change this to a secure password`).
3. Start the services:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    Alternatively, use the "Start/Update Server Applications (Docker Compose)" VSCode task.

4. **Database Initialization:**
    * The MariaDB service in `serverSide/docker-compose.yml` is configured to automatically import any `*.sql` files placed in its `/config/initdb.d/` directory upon first startup.
    * The project's `serverSide/databaseSetup.sql` is mapped to this directory, ensuring the database schema is created when the MariaDB container is first run.

5. **Node-RED TTN Integration & Setup:**
    * **Credential Encryption:** The Node-RED `flows_cred.json` file (which stores sensitive credentials for your flows) is encrypted. A `credentialSecret` is defined in `serverSide/nodered/settings.js`.
        * **ACTION REQUIRED FOR NEW USERS/DEPLOYMENTS:** The current `credentialSecret` in `serverSide/nodered/settings.js` is a placeholder (`change_this_to_a_strong_secret`). For security, change this to a strong, unique secret and store your chosen secret securely. Failure to use a strong, unique secret poses a security risk. After changing it, restart Node-RED and re-deploy your flows (make any minor change and deploy) to apply the new encryption key.
    * Use the JavaScript decoder from `serverSide/javascriptDecoder/decoder.js` and add it to the application decoder in The Things Network console.
    * For Node-RED Git integration (if needed for flow management), refer to the setup guide in `docs/server-and-nodered-setup.md`.
    * **Note on `serverSide/nodered`:** This directory was previously managed as a Git submodule. It has now been integrated directly into the main repository. Its contents are part of the main project's working tree and should be staged and committed as regular files.

### Node (The Things Uno) Development

1. Open the Arduino project: `nodeCode/nodeCode.ino` using the Arduino IDE.
2. **Configure Secrets:**
    * Copy `nodeCode/secrets.example.h` to `nodeCode/secrets.h`.
    * Edit `nodeCode/secrets.h` and add your personal keys from The Things Network (TTN).
3. **Compiling with `arduino-cli` (Recommended):**
    * Ensure `arduino-cli` is installed (see [arduino-cli installation guide](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/installation/)).
    * Update core index and install the AVR core (for Arduino Leonardo / The Things Uno):

        ```bash
        arduino-cli core update-index
        arduino-cli core install arduino:avr
        ```

    * Install necessary libraries:

        ```bash
        arduino-cli lib install OneWire
        arduino-cli lib install DallasTemperature
        # TheThingsNetwork library is included locally in nodeCode/
        ```

    * Compile the sketch (from the project root directory):

        ```bash
        arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:avr:leonardo nodeCode/nodeCode.ino
        ```

    * **Finding your The Things Uno's Serial Port:**
        Before uploading, you need to identify the serial port your The Things Uno is connected to. Run the following command:

        ```bash
        arduino-cli board list
        ```

        Look for an entry corresponding to "Arduino Leonardo" (as The Things Uno is Leonardo-based) and note its port (e.g., `/dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX` on macOS/Linux, or `COMX` on Windows).
    * **Uploading the Sketch:**
        Once you have the port, use it in the upload command. Replace `YOUR_SERIAL_PORT` with the identified port:

        ```bash
        arduino-cli upload -p YOUR_SERIAL_PORT --fqbn arduino:avr:leonardo nodeCode/nodeCode.ino
        ```

        For example:

        ```bash
        # arduino-cli upload -p /dev/cu.usbmodem11401 --fqbn arduino:avr:leonardo nodeCode/nodeCode.ino
        ```

        (Note: Ensure no other applications, like a serial monitor, are using the port, as this can cause "Resource busy" errors. Uploading might also require specific permissions.)
    * **Monitoring Serial Output:**
        You can monitor the serial output from your The Things Uno using `arduino-cli` directly in your terminal or via a VSCode task:
        * **VSCode Task (Recommended):** Run the "Monitor Arduino (nodeCode.ino) - Auto-detect Port" task from the Command Palette. This will attempt to find your Arduino's port automatically.
        * **Command Line (Manual Port):** If the auto-detect task fails or you prefer to specify the port manually, first identify your port with `arduino-cli board list`. Then, replace `YOUR_SERIAL_PORT` with the identified port:

            ```bash
            arduino-cli monitor -p YOUR_SERIAL_PORT --fqbn arduino:avr:leonardo
            ```

## Muskrat Trap IoT Node Firmware

## Project Overview

This project implements the firmware for a LoRaWAN-enabled muskrat trap IoT node, designed for ultra-low-power operation and reliable event-driven reporting. The node detects trap door, catch, and displacement events, monitors battery status, and transmits data via LoRaWAN to The Things Network (TTN).

## Project Setup

### Hardware

* Arduino Leonardo (The Things Uno)

* HAN IoT Shield (with door, catch, displacement sensors, and battery monitor)

### Software Requirements

* Arduino CLI

* Required libraries:
  * TheThingsNetwork_HANIoT
  * LowPower (install via Arduino Library Manager)
* macOS (default shell: bash)

### Build & Flash

1. Install dependencies and libraries as above.
2. Compile (Debug):

   ```bash
   arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:avr:leonardo --build-property "compiler.cpp.extra_flags=-DENABLE_DEBUG_SERIAL=true" nodeCode/nodeCode.ino
   ```

3. Flash (Debug, auto-detect port):

   ```bash
   arduino-cli upload -p $(arduino-cli board list | grep 'arduino:avr:leonardo' | head -n 1 | awk '{print $1}') --fqbn arduino:avr:leonardo nodeCode/nodeCode.ino
   ```

4. Monitor serial output:

   ```bash
   arduino-cli monitor -p $(arduino-cli board list | grep 'arduino:avr:leonardo' | head -n 1 | awk '{print $1}') --fqbn arduino:avr:leonardo
   ```

## Progress Tracker

### To-Do

* Add explicit UML diagrams (as image files) for the payload encoder/decoder and database schema.
* Add a technical hand-over document (Markdown or PDF).
* Export peer review/feedback DOCX files to PDF or Markdown for easier verification.
* Add the final presentation slides or a link to them.
* Include explicit test result files or screenshots showing successful test runs and dashboard operation.

### In-Progress

* **[~] Refactoring `nodeCode.ino` for Event-Driven Operation:**
  * Added `volatile boolean` flags (`doorEvent`, `catchEvent`, `displacementEvent`) for specific sensor events.
  * Created placeholder ISR functions (`doorSensorISR`, `catchSensorISR`, `displacementSensorISR`) that set these flags.
  * Added commented-out placeholder `attachInterrupt()` calls in `setup()`, highlighting the pin compatibility issues for default sensor pins (8 and 9) on Arduino Leonardo and noting the need for re-wiring or PCINTs.
  * Modified the main `loop()` to check these flags and trigger LoRaWAN sends based on them, in addition to existing WDT/timed heartbeats.
  * Added a placeholder sleep function `enterSleepModePlaceholder()` and a call to it in the loop.
  * **Note:** The interrupt setup is currently a placeholder due to pin limitations. Full interrupt functionality requires hardware changes or more complex PCINT implementation. The sleep functionality is also a placeholder.

### Done

* All major firmware, server, and dashboard tasks are complete and verified.
* Fixed variable redeclaration errors for sensor state variables in `nodeCode.ino`.
* Updated include guards in all sensor header files to unique names to avoid macro conflicts.
* Ensured the code compiles and flashes successfully to the Arduino Leonardo (The Things Uno).
* Improved serial debug output: all sensor and payload data now printed in a single, clear block.
* Made unixTime increment every second and included it in both payload and debug output.
* Removed redundant debug lines for sensor and battery status.
* Added LowPower sleep (8x125ms) between main loop iterations for basic low-power operation.
* Provided instructions to install the LowPower library.
* Updated README.md to document the new event-driven, low-power design requirements, rationale, and current progress.
* Outlined the next step: refactor to use hardware interrupts and watchdog timer for true event-driven, ultra-low-power operation.
* Sleep logic is currently disabled in `nodeCode.ino` for debugging and bring-up. The device will remain awake and responsive. To re-enable low-power operation, uncomment the sleep section in the main loop.
* Verified: Data is being sent and received as expected with sleep disabled. Next step is to re-enable and test low-power operation once event logic is fully validated.
* Updated: displacementSensor now uses leftGreenLED (LED3) for displacement indication, resolving the LED conflict with catchSensor.
* All sensor-to-LED mappings are now unique and match the HAN IoT Shield hardware layout.
* All server-side, Node-RED, and Grafana dashboard integration steps are complete and verified.
* Documentation is consolidated and up to date in `/docs` and Doxygen.
* All code and configuration changes have been tested and verified as of 2025-06-09.
* **[X] Included screenshots of the Grafana dashboard in the documentation as image files.**
* **[X] Included screenshots of the Node-RED dashboard and Node-RED flow in the documentation as image files.**

## Design Notes & Rationale

* **Event-Driven, Ultra-Low-Power Design:**
  * The node sleeps most of the time, waking only on trap events (button press) or at a heartbeat interval.
  * Hardware interrupts are used for instant wakeup on trap events, minimizing power consumption.
  * The watchdog timer is used for periodic wakeup (heartbeat), ensuring regular status updates even if no events occur.
  * **Transmission Strategy:**
    * The node implements a hybrid event-driven and periodic (heartbeat) transmission strategy:
      * **Event-Driven:** On trap events (door, catch, displacement), the node sends data immediately, but enforces a debounce interval (default: 2s) to avoid flooding.
      * **Periodic (Heartbeat):** The node sends a full status update at a fixed interval (default: 24h, set to 10s for testing) to confirm health and status.
      * **Duty Cycle Compliance:** The node enforces a minimum interval between transmissions (default: 12s for demo, increase for production) to comply with LoRaWAN/TTN duty cycle and Fair Use Policy (max 30s airtime/day).
      * **Payload Optimization:** Only changed or relevant data is sent, using binary encoding. Battery and diagnostics are included in periodic messages, not every event.
      * **Class A Operation:** The node uses LoRaWAN Class A for maximum energy efficiency.
      * **ADR:** Adaptive Data Rate is enabled for static nodes to optimize airtime and battery.
    * This approach maximizes battery life, ensures regulatory compliance, and provides timely event reporting.
  * **Debug Output:**
    * All sensor and payload data are printed in a single, clear debug block for easier troubleshooting.
  * **unixTime Handling:**
    * unixTime is incremented every second and included in both payload and debug output for accurate event tracking.
  * **LowPower Library:**
    * Used for sleep modes; instructions for installation are included below.

---

## LoRaWAN Duty Cycle & Transmission Strategy (Implementation Summary)

* **Duty Cycle (EU868):**
  * 1% per sub-band (regulatory); TTN Fair Use: max 30s uplink airtime/day/device.
  * Node enforces a minimum interval between transmissions (default: 12s for demo; increase for production).
* **Transmission Logic:**
  * **Event-Driven:** If a sensor event (door, catch, displacement) is detected, the node will attempt to send data immediately. However, a transmission will only occur if the minimum interval since the last send (duty cycle) has elapsed. This prevents spamming and ensures regulatory compliance. A debounce interval is also enforced to avoid repeated sends from noisy sensors.
  * **Periodic (Heartbeat):** If no event occurs, the node will send a status update at a fixed interval (heartbeat), but only if the minimum interval since the last send has elapsed.
  * **No send** if neither an event nor the heartbeat interval is due, or if the minimum interval has not elapsed since the last transmission.
* **Payload:**
  * Binary, minimal, only changed/relevant data.
  * Battery/diagnostics in periodic messages.
* **LoRaWAN Class:**
  * Class A (default, most energy-efficient).
  * ADR enabled for static nodes.
* **Best Practices:**
  * No JSON in payload, use int8/int16 for values.
  * Batch data if possible.
  * Only send if state changed or heartbeat elapsed.

## Troubleshooting: VS Code Arduino Compile Errors

If you see errors in VS Code about undefined symbols such as `Serial1`, `MCUSR`, `WDTCSR`, or other Arduino/AVR-specific registers, these are not actual code problems. They are caused by VS Code's C++ static analysis not using the correct Arduino toolchain for IntelliSense. As long as the code compiles and runs on the Arduino hardware using `arduino-cli` or the Arduino IDE, you can safely ignore these warnings. For best results, use the provided VS Code tasks or the Arduino IDE for building and uploading firmware.

---

## Replication Guide

* Follow the steps in **Project Setup** above to build, flash, and monitor the node.
* Ensure all hardware connections (buttons, sensors) match the pin assignments in `nodeCode.ino`.
* For event-driven operation, ensure the node is powered by battery and not USB for accurate low-power testing.

---

## Architectural Decisions & Learnings

* See **Design Notes & Rationale** above for key decisions and best practices.
* Interrupt-driven wakeup and watchdog-based heartbeat are essential for ultra-low-power IoT nodes.
* All progress and technical decisions are tracked in this README for rapid recovery and onboarding.

## Hardware Interrupt Limitations and Event-Driven Operation

### Leonardo Interrupt Capabilities

* **Pins 2 (INT1) and 3 (INT0)** are the only true external interrupt pins on the Arduino Leonardo (ATmega32u4).
* **Pins 8 and 9** (used by HAN IoT Shield buttons for door/catch) do **not** support Pin Change Interrupts (PCINT) on Leonardo, unlike on ATmega328-based boards.
* As a result, only one sensor (or button) can be truly event-driven with instant wakeup from deep sleep using interrupts, unless hardware is re-wired.

### Current Implementation

* The firmware attaches the generic event ISR to pin 2 (INT1) for demonstration.
* ISRs for door, catch, and displacement events are present in code, but not attached due to hardware limitations.
* All event flags are checked atomically in the main loop, and the code is structured for easy adaptation if hardware changes are made.

### Options for True Event-Driven Operation

* **Re-wire sensors/buttons to pins 2 and/or 3** to enable true interrupt-driven wakeup for those events.
* **Use polling** for pins 8/9, but this increases power consumption and is not recommended for ultra-low-power operation.
* **Switch to a board with more interrupt-capable pins** (e.g., ATmega328P-based Uno/Nano) if all sensors must be interrupt-driven.

### Sleep Mode

* The current `enterSleepModePlaceholder()` is a stub. Replace with LowPower library calls for real deployment.
* Only INT0/INT1 and WDT can wake the Leonardo from deep sleep.

---

## Event, Debounce, and Duty Cycle Logic

* **Event-driven sends**: On any event flag (door, catch, displacement, or generic), the node attempts to send, but only if debounce and duty cycle intervals have elapsed.
* **Heartbeat sends**: The node sends a periodic heartbeat (via WDT or timer) if the duty cycle allows.
* **All logic is documented in Doxygen comments in `nodeCode.ino` for educational clarity.**

---

## Next Steps

* Finalize and test actual interrupt attachment for all sensors (requires hardware changes for full support).
* Replace sleep placeholder with LowPower library logic.
* Continue to update this README as implementation progresses.

## UML Class Diagrams

The following UML class diagrams are auto-generated by Doxygen (with Graphviz) and included in the documentation:

* **Payload Encoder/Decoder:**
  * See `docs/doxygen/html/classpayload_encoder.html` and `classpayload_decoder.html` for the latest diagrams.
  * To view or export as image: open the HTML file, right-click the class diagram, and save as PNG/SVG for use in reports or presentations.
* **Sensor Abstractions:**
  * Diagrams for `doorSensor`, `catchSensor`, `displacementSensor`, and `batterySensor` are also available in the Doxygen HTML output.

> **Note:** The database UML diagram is intentionally omitted as per project decision.

All code UML diagrams are up to date and included in the documentation.
